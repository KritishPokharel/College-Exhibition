# College-Exhibition
This repo consist of the final image of the project my team along with I built for different inter-school exhibitions.

Brief info about project: My team and I identified the major areas in a home that we can automate to improve
our lifestyle. The automation includes voice-controlled lights, smart dustbin, IoT-based LPG leakage detection
system, Smart Irrigation System, and IoT-based water level indicator for water tanks. We also recognized the
probability of sharp-turning collisions and constructed a two-way IR-based traffic light system for those roads. All
these technologies we built were installed in a cardboard-crafted house surrounded by a garden and turning
streets.
Our project won two first runner-up trophies in KMC Techno Fest and Trinity Sci-Tech and Management Expo.
